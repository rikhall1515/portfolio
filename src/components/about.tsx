      <p>
        Hard working software developer and computer science graduate. I love
        solving problems and picking up new skills required for any given task.
        As a hobby I love playing piano. I have studied music academically
        (classical, and jazz) for a combined total of 8 years since I was 12
        years old, alongside my main education.
